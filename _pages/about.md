    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently a PhD candidate at INRIA and DI ENS Paris, specializing in stochastic models for shared transport systems, under the supervision of Christine Fricker and Hanene Mohamed.

      I pursued  a bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the University of Trento, Italy.  Then I obtained a masterâ€™s degree in Applied Probability and Statistics jointly pursued at the University of Trento and Sorbonne University in Paris.
